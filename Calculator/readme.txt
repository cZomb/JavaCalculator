Java Calculator

Written in Eclipse using JavaSE-17 Libraries

Main goal while developing this software was to explore using the Swing and AWT libraries
Calculator works with mouse input on different button presses then outputs any calculations 
to the bottom text area

Operations are +, -, *, / and %
% is used as modulus in this example

A challenge faced while developing was when an operation was pressed after the equals button 
since no new number values were entered in between

A simple solution was to create a boolean value that influences which methods are called during
the operation button presses

Currently the +/- button is not implemented but I am working on making it functional in the future

Future updates will allow for keyboard inputs

This project is pretty simple to use, just include both java files in the same package and run 
them as a normal program
